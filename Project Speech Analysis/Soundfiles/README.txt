This folder contains the sound files outputs of our basic vocoder and RELP coder systems, and also the original soundfile anvsb1.wav.

There are six soundfiles from our systems where three is from the MATLAB implementation and three from the C implementation.

The three files, from both MATLAB and C, is the output of the basic vocoder, RELP coder with up sampling and RELP coder with high frequency regeneration method.

The file names will explain which programming language and system it belongs to. The file name is organised as “System”-“Program”.wav (for example: basicMATLAB.wav)
